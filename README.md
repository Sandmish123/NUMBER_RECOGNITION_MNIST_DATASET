# NUMBER_RECOGNITION_MNIST_DATASET
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Number Recognition :
Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits.Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
# SOLUTIONS
In this project, I used TensorFlow and imported the test and train datasets of MNIST. I then applied normalization to the data. After that, I augmented the dataset by creating multiple images. Next, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three layers, using an input size of 28x28. During training, I modified the learning rate scheduler, with 15 epochs and a batch size of 128. I achieved an impressive training accuracy of 98.77%. I saved the model's predictions in a submission file. Finally, I visualized my predictions to complete the project.
